    "<p>Welcome to this web based content editor proto type.</p>
     <p>When starting this editor you are presented with three panels.
        Right now only the bottom panel shows anything interesting
        so let us focus on that for now, Each of the dots you
        can see represents an <b>operator</b></p>
     <p>The dot to the right for example is a <b>generator</b> It simply
        produces a triangle with a default size. The dot to the right
        is a <b>transformation</b>. It's is connected to the triangle operator
        and is therefore <b>applied</b> to it.</p>
     <p>Why don't you click on the transformation operator now ?</p>"))

     <p>If you change a property the changed value will be remembered
